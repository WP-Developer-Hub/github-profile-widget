**Patch (for Chinese visitors):**

Because Google's service is not avaliable in China, the Google Fonts CDN always works bad in China. So the previous version of this plugin is not work well for Chinese visitors. This patched function provide an option to use Chinese CDN (http://fonts.lug.ustc.edu.cn/) instead of Google CDN (http://fonts.googleapis.com). You can dicide use Chinese CDN or not by choose the options on the new-added submenu under "Settings".
