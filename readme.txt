## ✨ New Features / Enhancements

This version adds several advanced features for **full automation, multi-widget support, and better usability**:

- **Token-Based Fetching**: Enter a GitHub token once — the widget automatically fetches your profile info and all organizations without needing to type in usernames.  
- **Dropdown Organization Selector**: Choose `"None"` to display your profile only, or select any organization to display its info.  
- **Multi-Widget Support**: Use multiple widgets on the same homepage, each showing a different organization or your profile, using the **same global token**.  
- **Toggleable Options**: Show or hide avatar, followers, public projects, email, blog, location, company, join date, contributions, and more.  
- **Caching**: Reduces API requests and prevents hitting rate limits.  
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Optional theme toggle per widget.  
- **Zero Maintenance**: Once configured, the widget continues working unless GitHub API changes.  
- **Automatic Updates via GitHub Releases API**: The plugin checks GitHub Releases and automatically notifies or updates itself when a new version is available.
